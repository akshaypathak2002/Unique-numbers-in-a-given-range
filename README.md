# Unique-numbers-in-a-given-range
To print the unique number number is a given range 
for example we are given with the range Left =10 and Right = 20
then our output should print 
10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
Here we noticed that 11 is not printed because it has repeated 11 

we solve this problem with the help of the dictionary in python
